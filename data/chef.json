Add 3/4 cup melted unsalted butter and mix well with your hands until the dough is smooth and elastic. Cover the dough and let it rest for 30 minutes. In a separate bowl, mix together 2 cups chopped walnuts or pistachios, 1/2 cup powdered sugar, and 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon. Set aside. Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). Take a small piece of dough and roll it into a ball about the size of a golf ball. Flatten the ball with your fingers and place 1 teaspoon of the nut mixture in the center. Pinch the edges of the dough together to seal the filling and form a ball. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. Place the maamoul balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for 15-20 minutes or until lightly golden. Allow the maamoul to cool completely before serving",

Cover with a damp cloth to prevent it from drying out. In a separate bowl, mix the chopped walnuts and melted butter. Take a sheet of phyllo dough and brush it with melted butter. Add another sheet on top and brush with butter again. Repeat this process until you have 6 sheets stacked on top of each other. Spread a layer of the walnut mixture over the phyllo dough. Repeat the phyllo dough layering process until you have used all the phyllo dough, brushing each layer with melted butter. Spread the remaining walnut mixture on top. Cut the baklava into diamond or square shapes using a sharp knife. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until golden brown. In a small saucepan, combine 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of water. Bring to a boil and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Add 1/2 cup honey and stir well. Let the mixture cool slightly. Pour the syrup over the baked Baklava while it is still hot. Allow to cool before serving.",
